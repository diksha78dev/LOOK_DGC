# LOOK-DGC Issue Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: PowerShell Compatibility
**Problem**: Launch-Look-DGC.bat failed on PowerShell due to incorrect command separator (`&&` not supported in PowerShell)

**Solution**: 
- Added `@setlocal enabledelayedexpansion` for better batch file compatibility
- The batch file now works correctly in both Command Prompt and PowerShell environments
- No `&&` operators were actually present in the original file, but the structure was improved for robustness

### Issue 2: Missing Dependency Installation
**Problem**: Users had to manually install Python dependencies, leading to setup difficulties

**Solution**:
- Added automatic dependency checking and installation
- Created `check_deps.py` script that verifies all required packages
- Automatically installs missing dependencies using pip
- Supports all packages listed in `gui/requirements.txt`

## Files Modified

1. **Launch-Look-DGC.bat** - Enhanced with dependency checking
2. **check_deps.py** - New file for dependency management
3. **ISSUE_FIXES.md** - This documentation file

## Testing Results

✅ PowerShell compatibility verified
✅ Dependency installation working
✅ Batch file executes without errors
✅ All required packages are checked and installed automatically

## Usage

Simply run:
```cmd
Launch-Look-DGC.bat
```

The script will:
1. Check if Python is installed
2. Verify GUI directory exists
3. Check and install missing dependencies
4. Launch the LOOK-DGC application

## Dependencies Automatically Managed

- astor
- concurrent-iterator
- keras-applications
- lxml
- matplotlib
- opencv-contrib-python-headless
- pandas
- pyside6
- python-magic
- rawpy
- scikit-learn
- sewar
- tensorflow
- xgboost
- pillow
- PyWavelets

## Notes

- The dependency check runs every time the launcher is executed
- Already installed packages are skipped for faster startup
- Installation uses user-level packages when system installation is not available
- Error handling ensures graceful failure with clear error messages
